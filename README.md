Here, I will be posting the coding examples and exercises that I complete from various open-source software design books. I am a beginner in terms of software design, so I'm sure there are mistakes in some spots, but I have enjoyed doing it.
Each book's folder contains a readme file with a link to the text.
Each exercise's folder contains a readme file describing the following:
  1. The topics discussed in the chapter that the exercises pertain to
  2. What I learned through the reading and completion of said exercises
