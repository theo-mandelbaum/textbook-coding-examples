# Exercise 5: How Good is SHA-256?

# Question:

# 1. Write a function that calculates the SHA-256 hash code of each unique line of a text file.
# 2. Convert the hex digests of those hash codes to integers.
# 3. Plot a histogram of those integer values with 20 bins.
# 4. How evenly distributed are the hash codes? How does the distribution change as you process larger files
