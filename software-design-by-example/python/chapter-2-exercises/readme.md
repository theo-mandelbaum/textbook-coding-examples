1. What topics were discuss in this chapter?

This chapter was focused on objects and classes. More specifically, chapter 2 covers objects, classes, named arguments and multiple inheritance. Dr. Wilson uses the idea of dictionaries, as objects, to showcase all of these ideas. This allows for the user to see the lookup order of the methods, using a "find" function. I found this to be helpful for improving my understanding

2. What did I learn from the exercises in chapter 2?

In chapter 2, I felt that I learned and benefited the most from the exercise that of writing multiple inheritance using dictionaries. Writing the classes this way forced me to think about how the inheritance was actually being implemented. I had to write name of the parent class and the names of the uninherited values in each dictionary. So, I had to know what was being inherited and what values needed to be set in each child.

Another piece of this chapter that I found helpful was the emphasis on packing multiple named arguments into a single tuple, or packing multiple positional arguments into a tuple:
    - Packing multiple arguments into a tuple is done by placing an asterisk (*) before the parameter listing, in a function definition. To unpack a tuple into multiple arguments, the asterisk is placed before the argument name in the function call.
    - Packing multiple arguments into a dictionary is done by placing a double asterisk (**) before the parameter listing, in a function definition. To unpack a dictionary  into multiple arguments, the double asterisk is placed before the argument name in the function call.
